ImgLoad!
=======

ImgLoad is a tiny plugin to help you load images in the background. To use it, call the $.imgload() function, passing the URL to the image, and optionally a callback function (with or without arguments) to be called when the image has finished loading.

Or, for deferred fun, call $.imgloading(), which returns a jQuery Promise object.
